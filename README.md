Created in 2020 for SparkHacks. The hackathons prompt focused on mental heatlh, as such Evexia was created
as a web application to help individuals susceptible to anxiety and panic attacks. 

Evexia focuses on providing the user with various outlets to help relieve there anxiety symptons. These methods were determined through research. 
By selecting the "Log" tab the user is taken to a page where they can journal and track their mood and stress. This can allow the user to identify
over time when they might feel more stressed and what could be a cause of their stress as well. 

For more immediate relief the user can choose the 'Mindfullness' tab. This tab features audio affirmations, white noise, guided meditation and therapist resources 
for the user. Depending on how severe there symptons are or there needs, the user can go through each of these activities. 

The webapp also features a "Game" which can allow the user to engange in grounding, a technique used to manage anxiety symptons by focusing on one's senses. 
The webapp was created using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
